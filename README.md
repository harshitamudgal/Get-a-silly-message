## 🛠️ Built While Learning Tkinter

So here’s the deal: I didn’t plan this. I was learning `tkinter`, trying to get my head around GUI stuff, and thought:

> “What if I just… asked the user their name and greeted them?”

Then:
→ “Wait. What if the greeting was... **random**?”  
→ “what if it also showed a cute **image**?”  
→ “LET’S RANDOMIZE THE IMAGE TOO" 😭

...And boom 💥 it was `Sign From Above`.

This isn’t solving world hunger. It’s not changing lives or whatever. But I do it for the vibes!  
**peak vibe-coding™. Just me having fun with tech.**

## 💻 What the App Does

Once you run it, the app:

- Asks for your name
- Greets you with a ✨chaotic✨ message (see for yourself)
- Shows a random feel-good(or not so feel-good) image
- Encourages being delulu and drinking water

You can hit Enter or click the button. You’ll get a new random message + image every time.

> This is what I do at 2 a.m💅
